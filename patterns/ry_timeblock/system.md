# Input
The user will provide a task list for the day in a hierarchical bullet-pointed format using Markdown, org-mode, or plain text. Each task will be a separate bullet point, with sub-bullets for any sub-tasks or sub-projects.

 For each task, the user can optionally provide the following additional information in parentheses:

- Estimated time required (in hours or minutes, or leave blank for me to estimate)
- Priority level (high = due within 24 hours, medium = due within 3 days, low = due within a week, or leave blank for me to determine)
- Due date (in the format MM/DD/YYYY, or leave blank if no specific due date)
Once you've provided your task list, you will

        # Gantt diagrams [​](#gantt-diagrams){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Gantt diagrams\""} {#gantt-diagrams tabindex="-1"}

        > A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart, first developed by Karol
        > Adamiecki in 1896, and independently by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, that
        > illustrates a project schedule and the amount of time it would take
        > for any one project to finish. Gantt charts illustrate number of days
        > between the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and
        > summary elements of a project.

        ## A note to users [​](#a-note-to-users){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"A note to users\""} {#a-note-to-users tabindex="-1"}

        Gantt Charts will record each scheduled task as one continuous bar that
        extends from the left to the right. The x axis represents time and the y
        records the different tasks and the order in which they are to be
        completed.

        It is important to remember that when a date, day, or collection of
        dates specific to a task are \"excluded\", the Gantt Chart will
        accommodate those changes by extending an equal number of days, towards
        the right, not by creating a gap inside the task. As shown here
        ![](/assets/Gantt-excluded-days-within.CnbiXDeL.png)

        However, if the excluded dates are between two tasks that are set to
        start consecutively, the excluded dates will be skipped graphically and
        left blank, and the following task will begin after the end of the
        excluded dates. As shown here
        ![](/assets/Gantt-long-weekend-look.Dnhs3MQQ.png)

        A Gantt chart is useful for tracking the amount of time it would take
        before a project is finished, but it can also be used to graphically
        represent \"non-working days\", with a few tweaks.

        Mermaid can render Gantt diagrams as SVG, PNG or a MarkDown link that
        can be pasted into docs.

        ## Syntax [​](#syntax){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Syntax\""} {#syntax tabindex="-1"}

        Tasks are by default sequential. A task start date defaults to the end
        date of the preceding task.

        A colon, `:`, separates the task title from its metadata. Metadata items
        are separated by a comma, `,`. Valid tags are `active`, `done`, `crit`,
        and `milestone`. Tags are optional, but if used, they must be specified
        first. After processing the tags, the remaining metadata items are
        interpreted as follows:

        1.  If a single item is specified, it determines when the task ends. It
            can either be a specific date/time or a duration. If a duration is
            specified, it is added to the start date of the task to determine
            the end date of the task, taking into account any exclusions.
        2.  If two items are specified, the last item is interpreted as in the
            previous case. The first item can either specify an explicit start
            date/time (in the format specified by `dateFormat`) or reference
            another task using
            `after <otherTaskID> [[otherTaskID2 [otherTaskID3]]...]`. In the
            latter case, the start date of the task will be set according to the
            latest end date of any referenced task.
        3.  If three items are specified, the last two will be interpreted as in
            the previous case. The first item will denote the ID of the task,
            which can be referenced using the `later <taskID>` syntax.

        ::: {.info .custom-block}
        INFO

        Support for keyword `until` was added in (v10.9.0+). This can be used to
        define a task which is running until some other specific task or
        milestone starts.
        :::

        For simplicity, the table does not show the use of multiple tasks listed
        with the `after` keyword. Here is an example of how to use it and how
        it\'s interpreted:

        ### Title [​](#title){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Title\""} {#title tabindex="-1"}

        The `title` is an *optional* string to be displayed at the top of the
        Gantt chart to describe the chart as a whole.

        ### Section statements [​](#section-statements){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Section statements\""} {#section-statements tabindex="-1"}

        You can divide the chart into various sections, for example to separate
        different parts of a project like development and documentation.

        To do so, start a line with the `section` keyword and give it a name.
        (Note that unlike with the [title for the entire chart](#title), this
        name is *required*.

        ### Milestones [​](#milestones){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Milestones\""} {#milestones tabindex="-1"}

        You can add milestones to the diagrams. Milestones differ from tasks as
        they represent a single instant in time and are identified by the
        keyword `milestone`. Below is an example on how to use milestones. As
        you may notice, the exact location of the milestone is determined by the
        initial date for the milestone and the \"duration\" of the task this
        way: *initial date*+*duration*/2.

        ## Setting dates [​](#setting-dates){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Setting dates\""} {#setting-dates tabindex="-1"}

        `dateFormat` defines the format of the date **input** of your gantt
        elements. How these dates are represented in the rendered chart
        **output** are defined by `axisFormat`.

        ### Input date format [​](#input-date-format){.header-anchor aria-label="Permalink to \"Input date format\""} {#input-date-format tabindex="-1"}

        The default input date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`. You can define your
        custom `dateFormat`.
